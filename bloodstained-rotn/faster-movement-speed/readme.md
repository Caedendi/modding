# Faster Movement Speed (multiple options)

![thumbnail.jpg](thumbnail.jpg)

## DESCRIPTION

Increases base movement speed for Miriam to one of the following options:

- 150% / 1.5x
- 125% / 1.25x
- 112.5% / 1.125x

**Will stack with movement bonuses** due to how the mechanics work.

## WARNING

As a result of the increased speed you might be able to reach early some places you wouldn't otherwise be able to, so bear it in mind if you want to prevent using that as a exploit.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

The following changes have been made to file `PB_DT_EnchantaParameterInitialSetting.uasset`:

- `NormalMoveUpRate 1.0 > 1.5`

This mod will be incompatible with any other updating this same file.

## DISCLAIMER

Provided screenshot is not to be taken seriously, speed lines will (sadly) not display when Miriam moves.

I simply changed the speed increase and repacked the file.
