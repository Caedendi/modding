# Invisible Passives and Silent Tis Rozain

![](thumbnail.jpg)

## DESCRIPTION

**Disables visual effects for the following shards**:

- Words of Wisdom
- Regenerate

It will not disable visual effects for the following shards:

- Healing
  - disabling the effect for this shard results in the passive not working properly
- Detective's Eye
  - requires changing a different file; you can use _masamunedragon_'s "Invisible Detective Eye and Bloodsteal Rings" mod to achieve this
- Money is Power
  - requires changing a different file; you can use _masamunedragon_'s "Invisible Money Is Power" mod to achieve this

**Disables the voice line for Tis Rozain**. The shard sound will still play, but Miriam will not shout the shard's name.
This change is included because both changes are done to the same file and I am too lazy to provide separate files.

## COMPATIBILITY

Will be incompatible with any mod updating file  
`Core\DataTable\PB_DT_ShardMaster.uasset`.

## CREDITS

Kudos to _ashtar01_ for their "Words of Wisdom / Healing / Regenerate Invisible" mod, which this one was based on.
I used their mod as a base, reverting their removal of the effects for the healing shard in order to prevent a resulting bug that prevented it from working properly.
