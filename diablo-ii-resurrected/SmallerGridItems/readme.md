## Description

Scales down the space items take in the inventory to a maximum of two slots.  
Has separate toggles for weapons, armor and miscellanous items. Mix as you please.  
Works by scaling down the item sprites, so it only works for vanilla items, so give mods that add items a higher preference in the mod loader.  
Affects all items bigger than two slots and, in addition, belts (to keep the gear scale more consistent).  
The main drawback is it limits the max amount of sockets to two, so don't use it if that's a deal breaker or use it only for the miscellaneous items.

## Known bugs

Some items seem to overflow into adjacent cells. This is actually due to vanilla grids being misaligned, like the shop menu. I don't know how to fix this at this time, as I don't know what files are responsible for that.
