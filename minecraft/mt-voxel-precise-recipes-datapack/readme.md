# MT Voxel Precise Recipes Datapack

## Description

Overwrites vanilla recipes with voxel precise, when possible, recipes.

## Math

1 block = 1 stair; 6 block = 6 stairs
1 block = 8 pressure plates (16x16x1); 2 blocks = 16 pressure plates
1 block ~= 5 trapdoors (16x16x3); 6 blocks ~= 30 trapdoors
1 block ~= 5 half doors (16x3x16); 6 blocks ~= 15 doors

### Exceptions

1 block = 96 buttons (6x3x2 voxels each); rounded down to 64 as that's the cap
6 planks + 1 stick ~= 6 signs (because you can only get so much out of a single stick)
